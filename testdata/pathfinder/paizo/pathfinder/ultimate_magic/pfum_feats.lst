The benefits you gain for this check depend on the skill you use. This is a mind-affecting effect.		SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats.html#_antagonize
Blighted Critical					TYPE:Critical																										PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=5																																																																																																																																																																																																															DESC:With a critical hit from a spell or spell-like ability, you give the target a minor spellblight.

The damage is acid or fire, as determined by the spell's descriptor. If a burning spell has both the fire and acid descriptor, the caster chooses what kind of damage is dealt by the burning spell effect. A burning spell uses up a slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.		SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats.html#_burning-spell

Create Reliquary Arms and Shields		TYPE:ItemCreation																																PREFEAT:1,Craft Magic Arms and Armor																																																																																																						PRESPELL:1,Consecrate,Desecrate																																																																																												DESC:Your magical creations are infused with divine power.																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:When you craft a magic weapon, magic armor, or magic shield, you may add one casting of consecrate or desecrate as part of the item crafting process. This increases the item's Price by 250 gp.  The item becomes a reliquary and can be used as a holy (or unholy) symbol divine focus of your deity. If you cast consecrate or desecrate, your reliquary counts as a permanent fixture for that spell while it remains in the spell's area.
Create Sanguine Elixir				TYPE:ItemCreation																										PRECLASS:1,Sorcerer=3			PREFEAT:1,Brew Potion																																																																																																			PRESKILL:1,Craft (Alchemy)=12																																																						PRESTAT:1,CHA=15																																											DESC:You can condense a fraction of your bloodline's power into a powerful elixir.																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:Once per day, when you clear your mind to regain spell slots, you can create a sanguine elixir. When you do, pick one of your bloodline powers. You transfer that power into a small potion that any creature can drink to temporarily gain the benefit of your bloodline power. Creating a sanguine elixir takes 1 hour, and requires special oils and distillates worth 100 gp, and when you make the sanguine elixir, you lose access to the bloodline power until the next time you clear your mind to regain spell slots. Sanguine elixirs are extremely unstable. They lose their potency 1 day after they are created.
Defending Eidolon					TYPE:General							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Shield Ally																																																																																																																																																																																																																														DESC:You have trained your eidolon to protect you.																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:Whenever you are adjacent to your eidolon, you can choose for the eidolon to take a -1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. When your eidolon's base attack bonus reaches +5, and for every +5 thereafter, the penalty increases by -1 and the dodge bonus increases by +1.

Deny Death						TYPE:General							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ki Pool																		PREFEAT:1,Endurance																																																																																																																																																																																																										DESC:Your ki is so strong that it can deny death.																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:As long as you have 1 ki point in your ki pool, when you fail your Constitution check to stabilize, you do not lose 1 hit point. If you succeed at the check, you can spend 1 ki point to heal 1d6 hit points. If you roll a natural 20 on the check to stabilize, you can spend 1 ki point to heal 2d6 hit points of damage instead.
Detect Expertise					TYPE:General																																																																																																																																												PRESPELL:1,Detect Chaos,Detect Evil,Detect Good, Detect Law,Datect Magic																																								PRESTAT:1,INT=13																																											DESC:You can detect the mystic specialty of a foe.																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:When you use any of the spells listed in this feat's prerequisites to detect a creature's alignment or its magic, you have a chance of detecting what spellcasting expertise it has. After you observe a creature with the detect spell for 3 rounds, it must make a Will save (DC %1 plus half your caster level). If it fails the saving throw, you learn what bloodlines, domains, hexes, schools, or mysteries (if any) the creature possesses. If the creature makes its save, it is immune to the effects of this feat for 24 hours.|10+INT
Die for Your Master				TYPE:General							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Tumor Familiar																																																																																																																																																																																																																														DESC:Your tumor familiar goes to any length to save your life.																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:If your tumor familiar is attached, and you would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the familiar throws itself in the way of the attack as an immediate action. If it makes a Ref lex saving throw (DC = damage dealt), it takes all the damage from the attack. If it fails, it takes half damage and you take half damage. The familiar must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to use this ability, and it can only do this once per day-if it is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, it can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow the familiar to make a Reflex save for half damage, its improved evasion ability does not apply on this saving throw.
Divine Interference				TYPE:General																										PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Divine=10																																																																																																																																																																																																														DESC:You can convert a spell to interfere with an enemy's attack.																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.149	BENEFIT:As an immediate action, when an enemy within 30 feet hits an ally with an attack, you can sacrifice a prepared divine spell or (if you are a spontaneous caster) an unused spell slot and make the enemy reroll the attack roll. The second attack roll takes a penalty equal to the level of the spell you sacrifice. You must sacrifice a spell of 1st-level or higher to use this ability. Whether or not the second attack is successful, you cannot use this effect on the same creature again for 1 day.
Dragonbane Aura					TYPE:General							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Aura of Courage											PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=8																																																																																																																																																																																																															DESC:Those within your dragonbane aura gain the same protection that you do.																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.149	BENEFIT:When fighting dragons, your aura of courage expands to a 20-foot-radius emanation, and allies in the aura gain a morale bonus on saving throws against dragon breath equal to your aura of courage's bonus against fear effects.
Echoing Spell					TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													DESC:You have learned how to release most, but not all, of a spell's potential when you cast it.																																																																													ADDSPELLLEVEL:3	APPLIEDNAME:Echoing																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.149	BENEFIT:When you cast an echoing spell, it does not disappear entirely from memory, and you can cast it one additional time during that day. No effect that allows you to reprepare or recast a spell can affect the echoed spell. If you prepare spells, this second casting does not require you to prepare it in another spell slot. If you spontaneously cast spells, this second casting does not expend another available spell slot.		SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats.html#_echoing-spell

You may inf luence creatures of that type with wild empathy, if their Intelligence score is 1 or 2, or they do not possess an Intelligence score. Once you choose the type of creature, it cannot be changed.	BENEFIT:Special - You may select this feat more than once. Each time, you may choose an additional creature type to influence.
Implant Bomb					TYPE:General							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Delayed Bomb																																																																																																																					PRESKILL:1,Heal=5																																																																																		DEFINE:ImplantedBombDisableDC|11 + classlevel("Alchemist")										DESC:You can attach a bomb to a creature that explodes when the creature dies or after 24 hours.																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.152	BENEFIT:You may implant a bomb in a willing or helpless creature (a mindless creature under your control, such as a zombie, counts as willing for this purpose). This takes 1 hour and expends 1 use of your bomb ability for the day. When the implanted creature dies or is destroyed, the bomb detonates in the creature's square as if it were a delayed bomb set by you (though you can set the bomb's damage to less than your normal bomb damage). You can use any bomb-affecting discoveries on this implanted bomb (acid bomb, frost bomb, smoke bomb, and so on) as normal. The bomb automatically detonates 24 hours after you implant it in the creature.	BENEFIT:If you expend 150 gp worth of alchemical reagents per die of the bomb's damage (for example, 750 gp for a 5d6 bomb), the bomb does not automatically detonate after 24 hours, and only detonates if the creature dies or is destroyed (24 hours after implantation, this bomb no longer counts toward your daily total).	BENEFIT:Implanting a bomb is as invasive as using the Heal skill to treat deadly wounds and leaves surgical scars unless the creature is healed by magic or abilities such as regeneration or fast healing. Some creatures (such as oozes, elementals, and creatures with the incorporeal quality) cannot have bombs implanted in them. Removing an implanted bomb requires a Heal check to treat deadly wounds, followed by a dispel magic spell or Disable Device check to neutralize the bomb (DC %1).|ImplantedBombDisabeDC		SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats.html#_implant-bomb
